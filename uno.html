				<h2>WHAT IS MAN REPELLER?</h2>
				<p class="tagline"> It means so many different things for the different people who touch it. For one reader, it might be a brain break — a way to escape from the particular banalities of his or her day. For another, it might encompass the world’s greatest shopping recommendations on earth (What? They are good!). For another cohort, perhaps it is a place to come and recognize that no topic is off limits for intellectual dissection. Hopefully for all of its users, it is a judgement free zone that allows you to be who you are, pants unbuttoned and all. As a rule, I tend to shy away from concepts, ideals…anything, really, that neatly fits in a box, and I’ve never wanted Man Repeller to fall into one, but the power of focus, particularly today, is such that if you can’t explain what you do while waiting for an Uber, you have a problem. So here we are!</p>

				<h2>WHO?</h2>
				<p> As a junior studying journalism at a liberal arts school in New York City, I hoped it might open doors when I applied for writing jobs following graduation. </p>

				<h2>WHY</h2>
				<p>Once I discovered there was an appetite for this kind of writing outside of my own interest, I took this show on the road, started to build a team and before you know it, there we were: 59 emails deep, trying to figure out how to succinctly explain who we are. So that’s it: we’re a small but mighty media company with a silly name but very important mission of making women feel more understood and less alone by fostering community and conversation on topics that run a gamut from style and power to culture and identity.</p>
